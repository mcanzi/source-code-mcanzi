Hello!

In the winter term of 2021 (October-February), I'm teaching a __Statistics__ course for MA students in Linguistics at Universit√§t Konstanz. The course is taugh fully online. You can find all of the video lecture material on Vimeo [here](https://vimeo.com/mcanzi). 

You can access lecture slides, source code and practice material from my github repo at **mcanzi/statistics-course** 

If you are interested in further tutorial and exercise material (or extra resources), please do not hesitate to get in touch with me via e-mail

Thanks

Max
