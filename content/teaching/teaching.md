Hello!

I'm now offering a wide range of workshops both online and in-person, tailored specifically to your learning needs. With my background as a data scientist in a linguistics department, I've had the chance to collaborate with dozens of research projects, and support over 50 students in achieving their research goals, in addition to teaching hundreds more.

My workshops delve into the fascinating world of quantitative methods, from introductory short courses on linear regression and linear mixed effect models to the more intricate generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs). Additionally, I enjoy teaching best practices in experimental design, quantitative analyses, reproducibility, and data visualisation and manipulation in Râ€”a field I am deeply passionate about. I am happy to teach R and __tidyverse__ basics, too,

All workshops are designed to cater to a range of learners e.g. MA students working on their dissertation, PhD researchers seeking specialized instruction, or staff members aiming to expand their skills, there is something here for you. Notably, I have a strong background in linguistics and data science, which allows me to offer a unique, tailored teaching experience to linguistics students and staff.

To gain an insight into what my workshops offer, please take a moment to check out my past workshops below. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out.
