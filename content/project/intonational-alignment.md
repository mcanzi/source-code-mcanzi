### Abstract

This study examines how proficient second language speakers of Belfast English and Northern Standard German realize cross-linguistic differences in intonational phonological categories and their gradient phonetic implementation. Belfast English and Northern Standard German select two different intonation patterns for nuclear pitch accents in declarative utterances. Northern Standard German features a falling pitch accent pattern. In Belfast English, a rising intonation contour is realised. 

The experiment compared the production of phonologically different pitch accents in declarative utterances and gradient acoustic characteristics of pitch range in utterancefinal position and peak alignment in nuclear pitch accents produced by native Belfast English learners of Northern Standard German with that of native Northern Standard German learners of Belfast English. The speech data were obtained in a collaborative map-task. Evidence was found
for accommodation for all three prosodic phenomena. 

However, the accommodation patterns were asymmetric in the Belfast English and the Northern Standard German group of speakers. Furthermore, both phonological contrastive characteristics and gradient phonetic acoustic detail appeared to be influenced by factors of cognitive entrenchment, linguistic function, perceptual salience and familiarity.
