__Summary__: Formally trained in quantitative research in phonetics and speech sciences. Since 2021, I am a data scientist and laboratory manager in the linguistics department at Universität Konstanz, where I teach MA-level courses in "Statistics", "Advanced Statistics", "Forensic Speech Science" and "Eye Tracking & Pupillometry" for linguistics students. I am an avid R coder. I also advocate for sensible experimental designs, clear and reproducible data science and honest scientific communication.
