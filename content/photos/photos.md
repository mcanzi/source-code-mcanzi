# __Nuptse__ - Hedera

_Hedera_ is a collection of four ambient drones improvised on the _SOMA Lyra-8_, a very unpredictable and wild analog synthesiser. The core of each track is composed of one single live take, with added layers of guitars and effects. Although all of the performances themselves are improvised, composing on the _Lyra-8_ takes careful planning and long sessions of trial and error. Due to the unpredictability of the synthesiser, it is almost impossible to obtain the same sounds more than once, which makes improvisation that much more exciting.  

In _Hedera_, calming and meditative ambient drones mix with layers of harsh noise and serendipitous melodies, combining comfortable and uncomfortable in almost forty minutes of improvisation.
