      <description>Summary: Formally trained in quantitative research in phonetics and speech sciences. Since 2021, I am a data scientist and laboratory manager in the linguistics department at Universit√§t Konstanz, where I teach MA-level courses in &amp;ldquo;Statistics&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Advanced Statistics&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Forensic Speech Science&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Eye Tracking &amp;amp; Pupillometry&amp;rdquo; for linguistics students. I am an avid R coder. I also advocate for sensible experimental designs, clear and reproducible data science and honest scientific communication.</description>

      <description>Synchronised movement and individual rhythmic skill influence the perception of temporal structure in spoken language Tamara Rathcke, Eline Smit, Rachel Yue &amp;amp; Massimiliano Canzi (2024)
Attention, Perception &amp;amp; Psychophysics, 1-17 | doi: 10.3758/s13414-024-02893-8
The subjective experience of time flow in speech deviates from the sound acoustics in substantial ways. The present study focuses on the perceptual tendency to regularize time intervals found in speech but not in other types of sounds with a similar temporal structure.</description>

      <description>Hello!
I&amp;rsquo;m now offering a wide range of workshops both online and in-person, tailored specifically to your learning needs. With my background as a data scientist in a linguistics department, I&amp;rsquo;ve had the chance to collaborate with dozens of research projects, and support over 50 students in achieving their research goals, in addition to teaching hundreds more.
My workshops delve into the fascinating world of quantitative methods, from introductory short courses on linear regression and linear mixed effect models to the more intricate generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs).</description>
