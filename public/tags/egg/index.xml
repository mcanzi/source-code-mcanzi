      <description>Output  (2018) Coretta, S. &amp;amp; Canzi, M. The effect of lexical frequency on vowel phonation as a correlate of /t/-glottaling. Talk presented at the Linguistic Association of Great Britain (LAGB) conference at the University of Sheffield.  Abstract Introduction. Lexical frequency is known to modulate the effects of a phonetic bias on speech production, such that high-frequency words show a stronger effect for a particular bias since they are exposed more often to that bias (Bybee 2004).</description>
